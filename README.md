# Cross-Platform-Program-Performance-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks

1. ACM-ICPC: This folder contains the program set we used for generating hardware counter features using PAPI toolset. It  needs PAPI library to compile and run (every on). Please follow instruction on this page to get the PAPI library([](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/software/index.html)). Under each year there is a Makefile. And the input sets for each program are in this google drive link [](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19Clnp5uDyAYnxy3qFIi_-qz770rRR58h). For each of the program it takes in two command line parameters. The first is input file and the second is output file. Each output file will contain the generated 37 execution features.
